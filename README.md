Something I hacked together in a few days to learn how 3D graphics worked.

Controls are as follows:

- **W & S:** spin around x-axis
- **A & D:** spin around y-axis
- **Q & E:** spin around z-axis
- **T:** toggle triangle outlines
- **P:** switch between perspective and ortographic projection
- **Arrow Keys:** walk around
- **I, J, K, L:** look around (inverted)
- **Mouse Wheel:** zoom in/out

All of this, including movement, is done by manipulating space by multiplying coordinate vectors and matrices together.

Only tested on linux; may work on windows idk
